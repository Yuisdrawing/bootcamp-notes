# Project 1: Fundamental design conversion project

For your first project, you are going to be given a design and your task is to match the design as closely as possible while writing semantic HTML, CSS and using Flexbox to help you achieve your layout. 

**This project is not responsive. It is only required to look good at the full width of your computer's screen!**



➡️ **[Project 1 files available here](https://github.com/HackerYou/con-ed-web-dev/raw/main/projects/project-1/Project1.zip)** ⬅️

Here is the design you will be bringing to life with code:

## Requirements

* Clean, organized, and properly indented code
* Semantic elements to describe your content along with accessibility minimums like `alt` tags for `<img>` elements
* Utilize Flexbox to complete the layout
* Include the `setup` snippet in your CSS
* Use an external stylesheet for CSS and link it to your HTML page
* Incorporate the appropriate images types via `<img>` elements or background-images
* Use Google Web Fonts for typography
* Match the design as much as possible
* Name the HTML file "index.html"
* Comment your code to help keep it organized and easy to navigate
* Include "Created at [Juno College](https://junocollege.com/)" in the site footer


## Bonus tasks

* Take a second look at your code. Can you make your code more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?
* There's a bonus design `Project1-LV2.jpg` included in the files, can you complete this bonus section? 
* Add a drop-down menu


## Tips to help you get started

**Drafting your HTML**

You should be working on your HTML first before you start CSS.

Analyze the design to plan out what semantic elements you are going to be using. Many students draw boxes on the design to help them plan. Reminder: semantic elements are used to describe the content of the page. Looking at the design and content of the page, how can you make use of these semantic tags?
```html
<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<main></main>
<section></section>
<footer></footer>
```

**Take a look at the style guide provided**

The style guide will give you information about colours and fonts used. Identify which fonts are needed and import them in your HTML!


## Things to keep in mind when you submit:
* Please zip up your project and name your project folder:  **firstNameLastName-projectNumber**
* Do not include the original project starter files (jpg designs, style guides, etc.), but please include your images!
* Submit your project even if it is incomplete! Please submit what you have - your instructor and mentors are happy to give you feedback on whatever you have completed!
* There are no grades, only feedback on how to improve your code!
* Plagiarism is taken very seriously. Copying someone's code without giving them credit is not acceptable - when in doubt, ask your instructor is something is considered plagiarism.
* Any submitted projects will be removed from Juno's archive two months after submission.
* If you are using a PC, please zip your folder and avoid compressing it into a .rar file!
* The link to submit your project is in the pinned messages in the course slack channel. Ask your instructor if you can't find it!
