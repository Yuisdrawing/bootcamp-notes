# Projects
Projects are here to challenge you to use all the skills you've been taught up to now! By keeping yourself at the edge of your abilities, you will accelerate your learning and you will be surprised at how much you know.  

Both projects will get written feedback, provided by Teaching Assistants at Juno.

Things to keep in mind:
* Please zip up your project and name your project folder:  **firstNameLastName-projectNumber**
* Do not include the original project starter files (PSD designs, style guides, etc.), but please include your images!
* Submit your project even if it is incomplete! Please submit what you have - your instructor and mentors are happy to give you feedback on whatever you have completed!
* There are no grades, only feedback on how to improve your code!
* Plagiarism is taken very seriously. Copying someone's code without giving them credit is not acceptable - when in doubt, ask your instructor is something is considered plagiarism.
* Any submitted projects will be removed from Juno's archive two months after submission.
* If you are using a PC, please zip your folder and avoid compressing it into a .rar file!
