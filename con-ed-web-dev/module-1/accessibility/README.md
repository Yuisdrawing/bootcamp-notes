# Accessibility and coding

We take accessibility very seriously.

Having an accessible website means that **everyone, including people with disabilities,** can perceive, understand, navigate, interact with, and contribute to websites. 

Different people use websites in different ways. For example, while some people navigate web pages with a mouse, others with mobility impairments (disabilities, injuries, etc) often use a keyboard; users with limited or changing eyesight benefit from higher contrast, larger fonts, and being able to zoom in to read text, or they might use _screen readers_ to hear a site instead of reading it.

We should be thinking about how people who have visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities use the web, and aim to create barrier-free websites. We call this the _human factor_ and it should be our top priority because the internet is made for, well, humans! 

Creating accessible websites also benefits site owners:
* It helps with SEO (Search Engine Optimization) 
* It opens your website to a larger business market
* Accessible code is easier to work with when multiple developers are working on one project.

It is easier and more efficient to build accessibility into a website from the start than it is to try to make an existing website accessible. We want to build accessible websites because everyone should be able to access the internet and use the sites we build.


## Ontario law

By Ontario law, you must make new and significantly refreshed public websites accessible if you are:
* a private or non-profit organization with 50+ employees, or 
* a public sector organization

Specifically:
* Beginning January 1, 2014, new public websites, significantly refreshed websites and any web content posted after January 1, 2012, must meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level A.
* Beginning January 1, 2021, all public websites and web content posted on or after January 1, 2012, must meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA, other than criteria 1.2.4 (live captions) and 1.2.5 (pre-recorded audio descriptions).

The organization or person who controls the website are responsible for meeting these accessibility requirements.

## Accessibility tips 

To help keep accessibility in mind, we have included accessibility tips in the notes. Here is an example of what they will look like:

> **Accessibility tip** 
>
> There are three levels under WCAG: A, AA and AAA. A is a minimum requirement and we should put every effort into ensuring that standard is met as we code. 
>
> A common tool used by those experiencing the internet with a disability is something called a screen reader. It is a type of _assistive technology_ (AT) that pulls meaning from the code of a website and announces it auditorily to the user. However, this technology cannot function properly if the site's code is not written in an accessible way, and the user would be unable to interact meaningfully with the site.

## Configuring MacOS keyboard settings

MacOS does not come equipped with default tabbing and focus keyboard capabilities necessary for assistive technologies to meaningfully navigate through web applications and websites. 

If you are using a MacOS system, you will need to configure your System settings to enable keyboard navigation for your Mac applications like Firefox. 

[Follow instructions outlined here to configure your System setting.](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlp1399/mac)
