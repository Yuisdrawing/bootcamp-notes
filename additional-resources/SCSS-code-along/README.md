> **Accessibility tip**
>
> In the code along, there is an `<address>` element used in the `<footer>` that holds all of the contact information for the company. The `<address>` element has an opening and closing tag and is a block element. It is used to identify any address-related content and can contain multiple `<p>` or `<a>` elements that contain address-related information, but cannot contain any landmark-related elements (`<section>`, `<nav>`, etc.). When used in the `<footer> `element, the `<address>` element's content is used in the SEO and by search engines to determine the author or company's information.

As an additional challenge outside of class, try adding media queries to make the website responsive!
