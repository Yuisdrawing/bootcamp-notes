# Client challenge
This is a design re-creation challenge. As a developer, it's very common to be given a design and asked to copy it as best you can.

The goal is to take one of the designs below and match it using HTML and CSS to make your re-creations as pixel perfect as you can! There is no answer key for this exercise because it's meant to help you dig into your creative side and explore. Move things around, see what happens with line height - go crazy! This exercise is about trial and error.

All designs should be interpreted as being 100% of the height and width of your browser. The designs come with the background images you need if the design has any, but it's up to you to find the font-families on Google Fonts and decide on the spacing and colours needed. Use the tools you have already learned like margin, padding, width, height, backgrounds and typography to help you out.

Choose one at random - it keeps life exciting (and challenging!)

## Suggested steps
* Bring the assets folder from your chosen design into the starter file.
* Complete the HTML first using semantic HTML. Take your best guess - this is how *you* interpret the design!
* Set up your CSS file by setting some base styles on the body, including colour and font family. Don't get too stuck right now on finding the perfect font family on Google Fonts. Set something that you feel looks similar and revisit it at the end.
* Link the background image from your CSS. Hint: The path from the CSS file should look something like this: ./assets/PHOTO-NAME.jpg
* Start moving your text around using margin.
* Make sure you are checking on your website in your browser by refreshing the page as you go.
* If something isn't rendering the way you expect it to, check for typos and missing semi-colons.
