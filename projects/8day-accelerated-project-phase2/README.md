# Design conversion project - Phase 2

During this phase of the project you will be building on what you have already made in phase 1 to complete the overal layout. This project is meant to call upon everything the course has covered and is meant to be challenging.

The project must be responsive, meaning it should work on smaller screen sizes, with the smallest screen size being around 320px in width.

You will notice the designs have been updated to include more sections to build! You are encouraged to build as many of the new sections as you like. You will use the same style guide from the phase 1 files and you can combine the assets into a single folder to use in this project.



➡️ **[Phase 2 files available here](https://github.com/HackerYou/con-ed-web-dev/raw/main/projects/8day-accelerated-project-phase2/design-conversion-project-phase2.zip)** ⬅️

## Things to keep in mind when you submit:
* Please zip up your project and name your project folder:  **firstNameLastName-projectNumber**
* Do not include the original project starter files (jpg designs, style guides, etc.), but please include your images!
* Submit your project even if it is incomplete! Please submit what you have - your instructor and mentors are happy to give you feedback on whatever you have completed!
* There are no grades, only feedback on how to improve your code!
* Plagiarism is taken very seriously. Copying someone's code without giving them credit is not acceptable - when in doubt, ask your instructor if something is considered plagiarism.
* Any submitted projects will be removed from Juno's archive two months after submission.
* If you are using a PC, please zip your folder and avoid compressing it into a .rar file!
* The link to submit your project is in the pinned messages in the course slack channel. Ask your instructor if you can't find it!
