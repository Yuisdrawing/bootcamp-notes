# Project 2: Responsive design conversion project

For this project, you are given the task of building a site from one of the provided designs below. This project is meant to call upon everything the course has covered and is meant to be challenging. Converting designs is how many developers get their start.

This project must be responsive, meaning it should work on smaller screen sizes, with the smallest screen size being around 320px in width.

Browse the designs below and when you find one that **speaks to you**, get started building your site! Each project comes with a desktop and mobile design along with assets.



➡️ **[Project 2 files available here](https://github.com/HackerYou/con-ed-web-dev/raw/main/projects/project-2/Project2.zip)** ⬅️

Both designs are included in this `.zip`, but you only need to choose 1!

* Submit your project even if it is incomplete! Please submit what you have - your instructor and mentors are happy to give you feedback on whatever you have completed!
* There are no grades, only feedback on how to improve your code!
* Plagiarism is taken very seriously. Copying someone's code without giving them credit is not acceptable - when in doubt, ask your instructor is something is considered plagiarism.
