# Design conversion project - Phase 1

For your project, you are going to be building a site from one of the provided designs below. Your task is scaffold the semantic HTML and incorporate a few CSS components. Converting designs is how many developers get their start.

Browse the designs below and when you find one that **speaks to you**, get started building your site!

**Phase 1 is not responsive. It is only required to look good at the full width of your computer's screen!**

The project files contain the style guide and assets to be used for this phase and for phase 2 which will be completed later.

➡️ **[Phase 1 project files available here](https://github.com/HackerYou/con-ed-web-dev/raw/main/projects/8day-accelerated-project-phase1/design-conversion-project-phase1.zip)** ⬅️

Both designs are included in this `.zip`, but you only need to choose 1!

These are the designs that you will be bringing to life with code!

## Requirements

* Clean, organized, and properly indented code
* Semantic elements to describe your content along with accessibility minimums like `alt` tags for `<img>` elements
* Include the `setup` snippet in your CSS
* Use an external stylesheet for CSS and link it to your HTML page
* Incorporate the appropriate images types via `<img>` elements or background-images
* Use Google Web Fonts for typography
* Match the design as much as possible
* Name the HTML file "index.html"
* Comment your code to help keep it organized and easy to navigate
* Include "Created at [Juno College](https://junocollege.com/)" in the site footer

## Stretch Goal (Give this a try, but don't worry if you can't get it done)

* Utilize Flexbox to start creating the layout

## Tips to help you get started

**Drafting your HTML**

You should be working on your HTML first before you start CSS.

Analyze the design to plan out what semantic elements you are going to be using. Many students draw boxes on the design to help them plan. Reminder: semantic elements are used to describe the content of the page. Looking at the design and content of the page, how can you make use of these semantic tags?

```html
<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<main></main>
<section></section>
<footer></footer>
```

**Take a look at the style guide provided**

The style guide will give you information about colours and fonts used. Identify which fonts are needed and import them into your HTML!


## Things to keep in mind when you submit:
* Please zip up your project and name your project folder:  **firstNameLastName-projectNumber**
* Do not include the original project starter files (jpg designs, style guides, etc.), but please include your images!
* Submit your project even if it is incomplete! Please submit what you have - your instructor and mentors are happy to give you feedback on whatever you have completed!
* There are no grades, only feedback on how to improve your code!
* Plagiarism is taken very seriously. Copying someone's code without giving them credit is not acceptable - when in doubt, ask your instructor is something is considered plagiarism.
* Any submitted projects will be removed from Juno's archive two months after submission.
* If you are using a PC, please zip your folder and avoid compressing it into a .rar file!
* The link to submit your project is in the pinned messages in the course slack channel. Ask your instructor if you can't find it!
