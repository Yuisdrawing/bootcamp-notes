# Text editors
One of the most important tools for a developer to use is a good text editor. It is where a developer does the vast majority of problem-solving and coding. Using the proper text editor, along with the right setup, can help a developer's productivity levels go through the roof.

HTML is written in plain text, so we could technically use Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac) to view and code our HTML files. The downside to this is that it's just black text on a white background, making it very easy to make a mistake!

Text editors give you something called Syntax Highlighting. It changes the colours of your tags helping you to quickly view/scan your code. When you make a mistake, the colour of the tag changes and it's visually apparent that something isn't right.

Note how all the tags are easily identifiable. When your code gets long and nested, it's very helpful to take advantage of these features.

## Choosing a text editor
There are many text editors in the world of development, and each has their own set of features. When choosing a text editor, you want to ensure that it's easily customizable and has an active development community.

At Juno, the Instructors use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it has many themes and plugins developed directly for it and it's very easy to use. As well, content in our notes is directed to the usage of VS Code on Mac and Windows. We recommend getting comfortable with VS Code as it's currently one of the most widely used text editors by developers.

Some other popular text editors that you might have heard of are:

* Sublime - [https://www.sublimetext.com/](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
Free unlimited trial use. Easily customizable and shares many of the same plugins, features, and themes as VS Code.

* Atom - [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)
Free, open source text editor from Github. Easily customizable and shares many of the same plugins, features, and themes as VS Code.

In this class, we're going to be using VS Code so we can all learn together using the same steps.

## Installing VS Code
Head on over to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to download and install VS Code if you haven't already. It's completely free to use - try to keep it up to date when it gives you the option to download a new version!

## The Open-In-Browser extension
VS Code comes with a lot out-of-the-box, but we need to install a free extension to be able to open our code right into our browser. This is just one of hundreds of free extensions available on VS Code! We're going to be exploring more of them later in the course.

* Click on the VS Code Extension button on the left side of your text editor.

* Type "open in browser" into the VS Code Extension search bar. Click on the top result. Make sure the creator of the extension is "TechER". Click the green install button.

* Boom, done! Now restart your text editor to make sure the extension takes effect.

* Let's make sure we're always opening up our projects in Firefox. 
Go to:

`Code > Preferences > Settings` for Mac

`File > Preferences > Settings` for PC

Click on Settings. 

This will open the settings of your VS Code. 

* Type "browser" in the setting search bar and then "Firefox" under "Open-in-browser: Default".

## Word Wrap
With your VS Code settings still open, search "Wrap" in the settings search bar.

Turn this option to "on" using the drop down menu. This will allow text to wrap to the next line instead of scrolling horizontally.

That's it! Your text editor is all ready to use.

## Using shortcuts
While we're coding, we can speed up our workflow by using shortcuts. Knowing common shortcuts can speed up general computer use as well. 

### Mac Users:
* cmd + tab  [**tab between open programs**]
* cmd + c  [**copy**]
* cmd + x  [**cut**]
* cmd + v  [**paste**]
* cmd + s  [**save**]
* cmd + a  [**select all**]
* cmd + z  [**undo**]
* cmd + option + left or right [**tab between browser tabs**]
* cmd + 1 or 2 (or whichever number of tab you would like to move to) [**switching between browser tabs**]
* cmd + options + right arrow key [**moving through browser tabs**]

### Windows Users:
* alt + tab [**tab between open programs**]
* ctrl + c  [**copy**]
* ctrl + x  [**cut**]
* ctrl + v  [**paste**]
* ctrl + s  [**save**]
* ctrl + a  [**select all**]
* ctrl + z  [**undo**]
* ctrl + 1 or 2 (or whichever number of tab you would like to move to) [**switching between browser tabs**]
* ctrl + options + right arrow key [**moving through browser tabs**]
