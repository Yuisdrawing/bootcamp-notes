# The Internet

## How the internet works

The internet is a physical infrastructure that delivers information from one device to another. The Internet is made up of wires (through electricity), cables (through light with fiber optics), and radio transmitters that transfer information over land and sea.

Here is a photo that represents the cables and wires that bring the internet across oceans:

## What is a website?

At the most basic level, a website is a collection of files that visitors can view when they type a URL into the browser. The requested files are pulled through the network and displayed in your browser.


## What happens when you visit a webpage?

When a URL is typed into a browser, the browser first checks its own history to see if that site has been visited before. If it has been visited, the website appears (because the browser has those files on hand).  If the website hasn't been visited, then the browser reaches out to the server that stores that particular website and asks for the files. The files are transferred to the browser as bits. Once received, the browser then serves up the files, and the website is viewable.

Technically, any computer connected to the internet could host a website. However, the website's files would only be available if the computer was on, and the computer would have to be powerful enough to serve up the files to however many browsers were requesting the site. Because this is difficult to do with personal computers, we contract out hosting to servers (computers) that are always on and can handle high demand.

Hosting companies such as Dreamhost and Green Geeks take care of hosting the files for us.


## Web browsers

A web browser is an application where users can see and interact with a web resource. There are a lot of browsers to choose from, but as web developers, it's best to choose a modern, _evergreen_ browser. Evergreen means that the browser is updated frequently, and those updates happen automatically in the background, without the user having to perform any actions. 

Firefox and Chrome are examples of evergreen browsers, whereas Internet Explorer is not. Both support current web standards and have tools for web developers built right in, but Firefox is our preferred browser because it is lightweight (ie. uses minimal processor power), has excellent, cutting-edge developer tools, and most closely matches official web standards.


## Front-end languages

Websites are built on three languages, which work together; _HTML_, _CSS_ and _JavaScript_. Browsers can only read these three languages. Each addresses a different aspect of the site makeup:

* _Hypertext Markup Language_ (HTML) defines the content of a site - the words and images that appear on the page.
* _Cascading Style Sheets_ (CSS) determines how the content of a site looks - the colors, sizes, positions, etc. of the things laid out in HTML.
* JavaScript (JS) lets users interact with the page - this lets things happen in response to a user clicking, scrolling, etc.

We will be exploring HTML and CSS in this course; a lot of great sites are built using only HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript.
