# HTML elements mock-up exercise

Every website starts off with HTML. Even though it might not look like the final product right away, when working on any new projects it's a best practice to start on the markup and only begin to add things like colours and backgrounds (using CSS!) once our HTML is completed. This ensures that we're building semantic, accessible and thoughtfully structured websites.

Keeping that in mind, download [this pdf by clicking here](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/html-elements-mockup--conEd.pdf) to see an example of a mockup that you might get from a designer when working on a new project. When converting a web design into code, it's important to think about how each part of the design comes together to form sections of content - should the logo and site navigation be grouped together inside of some `<nav>` tags? Where does the `<footer>` begin and end?

Your challenge is to create the HTML that would build the structure for this website by using [this file (click here to download) as your base](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/html-elements-mockup--conEd.html) (Note: The file will look blank in your browser! Make sure to open it up in your editor!). In the future, it will be up you to look at a design and identify what elements are used for different sections of a website, but because this is our first time doing this, the elements have already been outlined in the mockup.

Keep the mockup open alongside the base file as you work - don't forget that the HTML you're writing won't look like the pdf and that's ok! The focus of this exercise is the structure.

**By the end of this exercise, even though it won't *visually* look the same as the mockup, semantically and structurally speaking, it will be identical!**

Some extra guidelines:
* For links, try to link to an external web page as well as internally using an `id`.
* Explore a placeholder image service to find an image that is approximately (300px x 300px).
* Use lorem ipsum to fill content areas - feel free to find one that *speaks* to you.
