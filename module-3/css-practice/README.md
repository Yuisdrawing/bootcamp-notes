## Exercise
The best way to learn CSS is to take some existing CSS and make changes to it to see what effect it has on the page. This is one of the best ways to get your feet wet with CSS before moving on to more complex topics.

Go ahead and open up [try-css--conEd.html](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/try-css--conEd.html) in both your browser and your text editor. Change the CSS values and see what happens!

## Adding your own markup
To get a handle on how to add and style your own markup:

* Create an additional section with a class of 'testimonials' right after the section with the class of 'description'.
* In that section, add an `h3`, a few additional paragraphs, and an image. You can use the absolute path to an image online or include an image in your folder locally and link to the relative path.
* Be sure to use the proper HTML tags to insert the content.
